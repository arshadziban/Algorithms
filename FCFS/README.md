# First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling Algorithm

## Introduction

The First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm is a simple process scheduling algorithm where the process that arrives first is executed first. This repository provides a detailed explanation and calculation of the FCFS algorithm using a sample set of processes.

## Algorithm Overview

The FCFS algorithm works as follows:
1. **Completion Time (CT)**: The time at which a process completes its execution.
2. **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: The total time taken from the arrival of the process to its completion.
3. **Waiting Time (WT)**: The time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.

The calculations are performed step-by-step for each process based on their arrival times and burst times.


## Algorithm Overview

The FCFS algorithm works as follows:
1. **Completion Time (CT)**: The time at which a process completes its execution.
2. **Turnaround Time (TAT)**: The total time taken from the arrival of the process to its completion.
3. **Waiting Time (WT)**: The time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.

The calculations are performed step-by-step for each process based on their arrival times and burst times.


## Example

The document includes a sample set of processes with their respective burst times and arrival times. Here is an example:

| Process | Burst Time (BT) | Arrival Time (AT) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| P1      | 24              | 0                 |
| P2      | 3               | 1                 |
| P3      | 3               | 2                 |


## Results
The document provides detailed calculations for:
- Completion Time (CT)
- Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Waiting Time (WT)

The final results are summarized in a table, and the average turnaround time and average waiting time are computed.
